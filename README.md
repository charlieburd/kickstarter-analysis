# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Look at the data from two points of view. The first, how Louise can time her funding campaign to begin during the best month of the year to fundraise. The second, how she can create a budget that has the highest probability of success based on how much she asks for.
### Purpose
Create an analysis that gives Louise insight and strategy into creating a successful theater play.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
**Insight:** Summer months saw a higher number of both successful campaigns and failed campaigns. When looking at the requested line graph, the summer months appear to be a clear advantage for a successful campaign. However, when you turn the data from "count of outcomes" to a stacked percent bar chart the swing looks much more subtle. Note: this png is different from the one we were asked for, the requested png is in the repository.

**Takeaway:** May and June are the two best months to begin a kickstarter campaign. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
**Insight:** As the Goal was increased the success rate decreased. This trend was consisted as each bucket increased except for $35,000-$39,999 and $40,000-$44,999. However only 2% of campaigns fell into those buckets.

**Takeaway:** Creating a goal of less than $1,000 has the highest chance of success. If that goal is to small, try to keep in below $4,999. If that is still too small ask for between $35,000-$44,999
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge was determining when to follow instructions exactly and when to problem solve a bit. An example of this was when instructions asked you to create an excel sheet and name it. It referred to "U.S." with periods in the sheet’s name. But when it asked you to copy a formula, the formula would refer to the sheet as "US" without periods, this would result in a REF error. This was not challenging for someone that knows the rules of excel but I can imagine it would be frustrating to people with no experience.
Another challenge was in Deliverable 2’s example graph for "Outcomes Based on Goals". The png provided did not match my work. It didn’t even have a Percentage Canceled line on the graph, but it was in the Key. I ultimately came to the conclusion the example was wrong.
## Results
**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
May is the best month to create a campaign. December is the worst month to create a campaign.

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
A goal of less than $1,000 has the highest rate of success. As the goal increases the cancelation rate increases, except for small bucket to bucket fluctuation.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
The data summarizes the US as a whole, whereas there may be certain pockets of the US where the production might have a higher rate of success. It does not include if the funds raised were from random patrons or people that knew the person that created the campaign. For example, a campaign that only had 10 backers could have had 5 of those backers be friends of the creator.

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
The graph I included from Deliverable 1, when outcomes were viewed as a percentage. A graph that looked at only Non-staff picks. Only about 12% of campaigns were staff picks, so Louise might want to take into account the likelihood of becoming a staff pick.
