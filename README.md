# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Follow the instruction to strategies with Louise give ins
### Purpose
Create an analysis that gives Louise insight and strategy into creating a successful theater play. Look at the data from two points of view. The first, how she can time her funding campaign to begin during the best month of the year to fundraise. The second, how she can create a budget that has the highest probabilty of sucess based on how much she asks for.
## Analysis and Challenges
A challenge was determining when to follow instructions exactly and when you have to problem solve a bit. For example, there were times when the instructions were asking for you to click on a button that was capitalized and in quotation marks. Then it would ask you to click on a button that was just plain text. The formatting was not consistent. Another example was when it asked you to create an excel sheet and name it, it refered to "U.S." with periods. But when it asked you to copy a formula, the formula would have "US" without periods. This was not too much off a challenge for someone that knows the rules of excel but I can imagine it would frustrate people with no experience.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
**Insight:** Summmer months saw a higher number of both successful campaigns as well as failed campaigns. When looking as the requested line graph the summer months appear to be a clear advantage for a successful campaign. However when you turn the data from "count of outcomes" to a stacked percent bar chart the swing looks much more subtle.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
