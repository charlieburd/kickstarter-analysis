# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Follow the instruction to strategies with Louise give ins
### Purpose
Create an analysis that gives Louise insight and strategy into creating a successful theater play. Look at the data from two points of view. The first, how she can time her funding campaign to begin during the best month of the year to fundraise. The second, how she can create a budget that has the highest probabilty of sucess based on how much she asks for.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
**Insight:** Summmer months saw a higher number of both successful campaigns as well as failed campaigns. When looking as the requested line graph the summer months appear to be a clear advantage for a successful campaign. However when you turn the data from "count of outcomes" to a stacked percent bar chart the swing looks much more subtle. Note: this png is different that the one we were asked for but is more telling, the requested png is in the repository.

**Takeaway:** May and June are the two best months to begin a kickstarter campaign. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
**Insight:** As the Goal was increased the success rate decreased. This trend was consisted as each bucket increased except for $35,000-$39,999 and $40,000-$44,999. However only 2% of campaigns fell into those buckets.
**Takeaway:** Creating a goal of less than $1,000 has the highest chance of success. If that is too small of a goal, try to keep in below $4,999. If that is still too small ask for between $35,000-$44,999
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge was determining when to follow instructions exactly and when you have to problem solve a bit. An example of this was when it asked you to create an excel sheet and  name it. It refered to "U.S." with periods in the name. But when it asked you to copy a formula, the formula would refer to the sheet as "US" without periods this would result in a REF error. This was not too much off a challenge for someone that knows the rules of excel but I can imagine it would be frustrating people with no experience.
Another challenge was the example graph it provide for "Outcomes Based on Goals". The png provide did not match my work. It didnt even have a Percentage Canceled line on the graph, but it was in the Key. I unlimately came to the conclusion the example was wrong.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the best month to create a campaign. December is the worst month to create a campaign.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A goal of less that $1,000 has the highest rate of success. As the goal increases the cancelation rate increases, except for small bucket to bucket flucuation.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data summerizes the US as a whole, where as certain pockets of the US where the production will be might have a higher rate of success. It does not incude if the funds raised where from random patrons or people that knew the person that created the campain. For example a campain that only had 10 backs could have has 5 of those backers be friends of the creator.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The graph I included about outcomes based on launch date when viewed as a percentage. A grpah that looked at only Non-staff picks. Only about 12% were staff picks so Louise might want to take into account the likelyhood of becoming a staff pick
